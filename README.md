# Superstes

I'm currently working as IT-Systems Engineer and started to fall in love with coding.

* Solving logic problems
* Planning and organizing structures
* Vizualising dependencies and interactions

What not to love? :wink:


My main expertise is in Python but projects in Golang are currently in progress. :grin:


On the IT infrastructure side of things I like to use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to implement infrastructure-as-code.
